"""build_assets.py — rebuild this study's analysis assets from its time series.

    python build_assets.py                   # every video in config.json
    python build_assets.py --check           # say what would run, change nothing
    python build_assets.py --write-manifest  # record what assets/ now holds

What this does
    Runs the shared analyses -- RQA, cross-RQA, cross-wavelet -- for whatever
    config.json enables, then any analysis this study ships itself in opt/.

What it does NOT do
    It does not produce the time series. Where those come from is the study's
    own business and differs between studies: motion capture from video, an
    eye-tracker export, a game log. If this study has such a step, it belongs
    in opt/ and this script runs it -- see the "study-owned steps" section
    below. Until then, put the CSVs in assets/timeseries/ yourself.

Knowing the rebuild is complete
    assets/MANIFEST.json is a tracked list of names, sizes and checksums --
    never content. A study whose data lives outside git has nothing else that
    says what a complete set looks like, so after a rebuild this script
    compares against it and says what is missing. Write the first one with
    --write-manifest, once you are satisfied the assets are right.

Where the data lives
    assets/ here by default. If the recordings live outside the repository --
    which is the norm for a study with identifiable video -- copy
    data.local.json.example to data.local.json and point it at them. serve.py
    and every analysis step resolve through it, so nothing has to be copied in.

Requirements
    The analyses are the dims-analysis package, not yet on PyPI:
        git clone https://github.com/dims-network/dims
        pip install -e ./dims
